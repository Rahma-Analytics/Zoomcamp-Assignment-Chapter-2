##Summarizing Data

Examining numerical data

Considering categorical data

Case study: malaria vaccine
  
        Examining numerical data:In this section we will explore techniques for summarizing numerical variables. For example,
consider the loan amount variable from the loan50 data set, which represents the loan size for all
50 loans in the data set. This variable is numerical since we can sensibly discuss the numerical
difference of the size of two loans. On the other hand, area codes and zip codes are not numerical,
but rather they are categorical variables.
 Numerical data can be examined by; scattered plots for paired data, dot plots and the mean, histograms and the shape, variance and standard deviation, box plots, quartiles and the median, robust statistics, transforming data (special topic), mapping data (special topic).

       A scatterplot provides a case-by-case view of data for two numerical variables, Sometimes two variables are one too many: only one variable may be of interest. In these cases,

a dot plot provides the most basic of displays. A dot plot is a one-variable scatterplot.  Dot plots show the exact value for each observation. This is useful for small data sets, but they
can become hard to read with larger samples. Rather than showing the value of each observation, we
prefer to think of the value as belonging to a bin.  Histograms provide a view of the data density. Higher bars represent where the data are
relatively more common, they are especially convenient for understanding the shape of the data distribution.     Data sets with the reverse characteristic – a long, thinner tail to the left – are said to be left

skewed. We also say that such a distribution has a long left tail. Data sets that show roughly equal
trailing off in both directions are called symmetric.
   
     Variance and standard deviation:The mean was introduced as a method to describe the center of a data set, and variability in
the data is also important. Here, we introduce two measures of variability: the variance and the
standard deviation. Both of these are very useful in data analysis, even though their formulas are
a bit tedious to calculate by hand. The standard deviation is the easier of the two to comprehend,
and it roughly describes how far away the typical observation is from the mean, We call the distance of an observation from its mean its deviation. 
The variance is the average squared distance from the mean. The standard deviation is the
square root of the variance. The standard deviation is useful when considering how far the data
are distributed from the mean.
The standard deviation represents the typical deviation of observations from the mean. Usually
about 70% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean and about 95% will
be within two standard deviations. However, these percentages
 are not strict rules.    
               

 CONSIDERING CATEGORICAL DATA
               
   Tables and other basic tools for categorical datas are ; constingency tables and bar plots, raw and column proportions, bar plot with two variables, mosiac plots, pie charts etc.
                

  CASE STUDY: MALARIA VACCINE

Variability within data

We consider a study on a new malaria vaccine called PfSPZ. In this study, volunteer patients
were randomized into one of two experiment groups: 14 patients received an experimental vaccine
or 6 patients received a placebo vaccine. Nineteen weeks later, all 20 patients were exposed to a
drug-sensitive malaria virus strain; the motivation of using a drug-sensitive strain of virus here is for
ethical considerations, allowing any infections to be treated effectively. According to the results, 9 of the 14 treatment patients remained free of signs of infection while all of
the 6 patients in the control group patients showed some baseline signs of infection.
