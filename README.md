##Summarizing Data

Examining numerical data

Considering categorical data

Case study: malaria vaccine
  
        Examining numerical data:In this section we will explore techniques for summarizing numerical variables. For example,
consider the loan amount variable from the loan50 data set, which represents the loan size for all
50 loans in the data set. This variable is numerical since we can sensibly discuss the numerical
difference of the size of two loans. On the other hand, area codes and zip codes are not numerical,
but rather they are categorical variables.
 Numerical data can be examined by; scattered plots for paired data, dot plots and the mean, histograms and the shape, variance and standard deviation, box plots, quartiles and the median, robust statistics, transforming data (special topic), mapping data (special topic).
