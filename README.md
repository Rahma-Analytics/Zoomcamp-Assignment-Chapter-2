##Summarizing Data

Examining numerical data

Considering categorical data

        Examining numerical data:In this section we will explore techniques for summarizing numerical variables. For example,
consider the loan amount variable from the loan50 data set, which represents the loan size for all
50 loans in the data set. This variable is numerical since we can sensibly discuss the numerical
difference of the size of two loans. On the other hand, area codes and zip codes are not numerical,
but rather they are categorical variables.
 Numerical data can be examined by; scattered plots for paired data, dot plots and the mean, histograms and the shape, variance and standard deviation, box plots, quartiles and the median, robust statistics, transforming data (special topic), mapping data (special topic).

       A scatterplot provides a case-by-case view of data for two numerical variables, Sometimes two variables are one too many: only one variable may be of interest. In these cases,

a dot plot provides the most basic of displays. A dot plot is a one-variable scatterplot.  Dot plots show the exact value for each observation. This is useful for small data sets, but they
can become hard to read with larger samples. Rather than showing the value of each observation, we
prefer to think of the value as belonging to a bin.  Histograms provide a view of the data density. Higher bars represent where the data are
relatively more common, they are especially convenient for understanding the shape of the data distribution.     Data sets with the reverse characteristic – a long, thinner tail to the left – are said to be left

skewed. We also say that such a distribution has a long left tail. Data sets that show roughly equal
trailing off in both directions are called symmetric.
